# unwind ☺✨

Just a project I am working on during my #100DaysOfCode challenge to create an app that can help people relax and unwind during stressfull times. 

TODO:
☑ HTML + CSS and frontend stuff
☑ Start a basic structure of the home page
☑ Have the site generate quotes or content that helps to unwind
☑ Try finding a soothing design
